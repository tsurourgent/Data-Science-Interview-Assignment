Calculate and output the following:

1) What is the total number of people living with HIV (NoPLHIV) in the listed districts according to the Survey estimate?

2) What is the average NoPLHIV of the two estimates used for “Xhariep”?

3) Add a column and populate it with the number of people not living with HIV for each row.

4) What is the total NoPLHIV in all the cities (districts with “city” or “metro” in the name)? 

5) Remove all the special/non-alphabetic characters from the dataframe column names. Print the resultant field names output. 

6) Using matplotlib, plot each Prevalence confidence interval (Prevalence_UCL and Prevalence_LCL) for Districts that end in “i”; according to Fay-Herriott estimates on 1 graph.
